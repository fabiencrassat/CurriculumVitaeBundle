# Protect your email and phone number

Email addresses are typically found on “Contact us” pages, however, they can also be found within scripts or code comments of the application. They are used to provide a legitimate means of contacting an organisation.

As one of the initial steps in information gathering, cyber-criminals will spider a website and using automated methods collect as many email addresses as possible, that they may then use in a social engineering attack.

In order to prevent this attack, sensitive information - email and phone number - can be encoded at the back of the server and decoded by JavaScript.
