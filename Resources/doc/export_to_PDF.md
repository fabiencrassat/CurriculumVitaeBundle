# Add an export PDF service

Mainly, Knp Snappy does the job.
For hosting that are not allowing proc_open(), a5sys PDF bundle is a workaround.

## Installation
*   Install the bundle ```knplabs/knp-snappy-bundle``` or ```a5sys/pdf-bundle```. Googleize to know how install ;)

## Deployment

* There is a route finishing like ```[url to CV/Lang]/pdf``` for each curriculum vitae.
